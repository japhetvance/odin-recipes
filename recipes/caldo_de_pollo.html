    <h2>How to Make Caldo de Pollo</h2>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>What is Caldo de Pollo?</h2>
    <p>Caldo de pollo is a type of Mexican chicken soup. Unlike other Latin American chicken soups, it uses whole chicken pieces instead of shredded or chopped meat. It also calls for hearty vegetables like potatoes and carrots, cut into large chunks.  </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds chicken leg quarters</li>
        <li>2 gallons water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>4 large carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>4 zucchini, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 chayote, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>½ bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
