    <p>This creamy baked mac and cheese recipe is one I first made three years ago when I was in California. When I got back to Texas, I made it for my mom. This is now her favorite macaroni and cheese. She begs me to make it when I come to visit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
